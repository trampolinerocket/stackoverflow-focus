// two-minute hack to promote focus on Stackoverflow

// e.g. remove the mostly ridiculous so-called 'hot network questions'

// this v0.0.1 does not block ad or job panel

// inspired by twitteropt/main.js via Andrej Karpathy

super hacky but I already love it

fork of AK's instructions:

Place this folder anywhere on your system, then go to 

- Tools / Extensions in Chrome
- make sure Developer mode (top right) is checked 
- Click button "Load unpacked extension..." (up top)
- Navigate to stackopt folder and open it. Extension gets added!
- Reopen a Stackoverflow tab, you're good to go!
